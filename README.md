# BloodBankSystem
## DATABASE:
This Blood Donation System uses a database for a number of its functions and modules. This allows the ease of recording
inputs, viewing records, managing outputs, organizing information, making queries, and real-time
monitoring. The database features a list of users and information regarding blood donations and
blood requests. This helps in digitally monitoring patients and donors in a convenient multi-function
system.

MySQL of phpMyAdmin (relational database) is used in our database management. It is the most popular
administration tool. It has an uncomplicated GUI and is convenient to use. The queries can be easily
edited and manipulated through the web supported medium that it holds. It is also flexible for the
majority of the commonly used file formats.

## FRONTEND and BACKEND:
The front-end language is usually visible to the user in the form of an interface. In this case, the
system uses the HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript as the front end languages and PHP for the
back end of the system. We use PHP because it is a server side programming language and it
harmoniously interacts with MySQL database -- which is the database we use to store information
that our system gathered.


## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The Blood Donation System is a donation system made for monitoring the blood donation and
blood requests. This system is mainly intended to help patients who are in need of blood to help
them during this time of pandemic. This application system is a great help for everyone especially
for the users such as patients and donors in giving and receiving blood assistance during the time
of medical crisis. Through this Blood Donation System, we can confirm the status of the patients’
blood requests and the donors’ blood donations. Aside from this, we can also see a variety of
generated reports and audit trails, both beneficials to the users and medical personnel.

## REGISTRATION:
Registering is necessary if the users wants to be a part of this community, either being a
recipient/patient or a donor. A donor user is the ones that are donating bloods to the patients who
are requesting to have a blood transfusion with.

## DONATIONS:
Donations are being scheduled through our electronic system which is indeed preferred because it
will lessen the paperwork that might cause the spread of the COVID-19 virus, thus prolonging the
pandemic, which this application system is trying to prevent from happening. Thus, only the
authorized personnel are allowed to do the transfusion of blood pints to the beneficiaries of the
blood donations.

## BLOOD DONOR:
Donors can make upto two blood pints per donation which is medically correct because a person
can only donate a maximum of 2 blood pints (900 ml) per appointment. A donor can donate blood
by clicking the “Add Donation” button in their dashboard. In the donation slip, the donor’s 
necessary information such as Donor Id, Blood Type, Contact Number, Full Name, Email, and
Username that they provided upon registration is automatically reflected in the donation slip so that
they will not have to redundantly fill those up again and again if they wish to donate a blood again
in the future.
After donating successfully, donors can view their total donations in the dashboard table. In the
table, the Donation Id, Blood Pint Donated, and the Donation Date is posted. This serves as the
proof of donation.
Donor users also have the capacity to change their provided data if it changes over time such as
their password, last name, first name, contact number, user name, and etc.

## BLOOD PATIENT:
Patients are only entitled to get a maximum of 2 blood pints. In the patient’s dashboard, they are
given a variety of functions such as requests for blood donation, viewing their transaction reports,
and editing and deleting their data. One of the most important functions that they have is the “Request
Donation” function. Upon clicking the Request Donation button, a patient is required to fill out the
request slip. The patients necessary information such as Patient Id, Blood Type, Contact Number,
Full Name, Email, and Username that they provided upon registration is automatically reflected in
the slip so the patient will not have to redundantly fill those up again and again if they wish to request
a blood donation again in the future. Then, the system will automatically assign a unique Request
Control Number to their blood request for the medical personnel to check later for further decision.
After submitting the request slip, their request information is being posted in their dashboard table so
they can also track the status of their request. Aside from the dashboard table, they can also view
their transaction reports on the side of their screen that is used to keep track of the result of their 
request status -- whether they are still pending, approved, or declined. Logging in to their own account
is necessary to check the updated status (Approved/Declined) of their blood request.

## ADMINISTRATOR/MEDICAL PERSONNEL:
The administrators or medical personnel are the ones responsible for managing the accounts of both
donors and recipients. They can monitor the activity logs of each user, access the file maintenance
module, track the generated reports, download the database backups, and audit trails. In addition,
they are also the one who manages the blood being donated and claimed at the time. The
administrators or medical personnel are also the ones who make the decisions whether to approve
or decline the blood request of the patients.
Every transaction made by the donor and patient are recorded in the admin’s file maintenance.
## This file maintenance are filled with essential reports such as the following:
• List of Donors
• List of Patients
• Blood Types Stored in Blood Bank
• Total Blood Availability
• Total Number of Blood Requests
• Total Number of Approved Request
• Total Number of Declined Request
Aside from these reports, the admin/medical personnel panel is also capable of adding new users,
modifying data, and removing existing users.
These reports are updated in the real-time manner as the users make interactions in their dashboards.
This real-time data is information that is reflected immediately after collection from each user. We 
are proud to say that there is no delay in the timeliness of the information transactions. We use the
real-time data for us to track the BDS users and know their activities.

## GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE:
The Blood donation system has a user-friendly interface that is made so that the target users may
easily understand and navigate through the system application. Another is that its system is designed
to give the results and reports needed quickly in real-time and conveniently which makes the
software fit for its target users. This will help increase the ease of use of the users, additionally, the
system contains more features and functions that helps in managing other tasks effectively.

## SECURITY FEATURES:
The system has a security feature to help keep its recorded files safe and secure. From the log-in
module to its applied security features, the system is secured in a number of levels. As for its
functions, menus, and key features, the system contains about a number of interactable elements
that help in viewing transactions, recording, generation of reports, auditing, notifications through
admin’s dashboard and database recovery management; all helpful in an office environment,
particularly to its target users and admins.
